        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Matteo Fania is from Rignano Garganico, a small village in the south of Italy. He began his studies in composition, classical guitar, and opera singing at the G. Frescobaldi Conservatory in Ferrara in 1994. A pivotal moment in his career came in 1999 in Ferrara, where he met Giovanni Privitera, a librettist and friend who would become his long-time creative partner. Both completed their studies in Ferrara, and their collaboration has been continuous and deeply influential, defining his artistic journey. Together, they founded a team called mg2Operagroup, dedicated to the study and creation of new operatic works.</p>

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p><p>His compositional work centers on a unique "sensorial" method, developed over two decades in collaboration with Privitera. This method has been foundational to numerous operatic works they created together, establishing a signature style characterized by rich emotional depth and interdisciplinary integration. Throughout his career, his partnership with Privitera has remained a driving force, continually inspiring him to push boundaries and expand the expressive potential of contemporary opera. He is also a multi-instrumentalist: bass clarinet, classical guitar, double bass, piano, tenor and alto sax, percussion, and baritone singer.</p>
